# dirtools-powershell-module
A PowerShell module to explore directories at the command line

The main tool behind this module was the Get-FolderTree command.  This command will display a branched tree of the current directory, with sizes for both the parent folder and the children files & folders

BTW! This is my first ever publically posted project, so I would greatly appreciate any & all feedback / constructive criticism on how this could have been better presented or structured
